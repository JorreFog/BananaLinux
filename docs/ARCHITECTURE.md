# How Banana works

## The card

| Where | What | Size |
|---|---|---|
| sector 64 (32 KiB) | U-Boot for the RK3568 (`u-boot-rockchip.bin`: Rockchip's DRAM init, U-Boot SPL, TF-A BL31, U-Boot) | ~1.5 MB |
| partition 1, `BANANA-BOOT` (FAT) | `Image`, the handheld's device tree, `extlinux/extlinux.conf` | 64 MB |
| partition 2, `banana-root` (squashfs, LZ4) | the system, read-only | tens of MB |
| partition 3, `BANANA` (exFAT) | made on the first boot from the rest of the card: `roms/`, `bios/`, `saves/`, `states/`, `banana/` (settings, logs, play stats, favourites), `drastic/`, `superdrastic/` | the rest |

The image only holds the first two partitions, so it is small and quick to write. `/usr/libexec/banana/firstboot`
moves the GPT's backup header to the end of the card, adds partition 3 and formats it (exFAT, so Windows and macOS
can read and fill it). The root is never written to; nothing on it can be corrupted by pulling the battery.

## Boot

1. The boot ROM loads U-Boot from sector 64. U-Boot is built with no boot delay, no environment and only the SD card
   as a target (ROCKNIX's Quartz64-based configuration for these handhelds, `board/rgds/uboot-*`).
2. U-Boot reads `extlinux.conf` and starts the kernel with `root=PARTLABEL=banana-root rootfstype=squashfs ro
   rootwait quiet`. There is no initramfs: the kernel mounts the root itself.
3. Everything the menu needs is built into the kernel: the two DSI panels (the generic DSI panel driver), the
   buttons (ROCKNIX's ADC joypad driver), the touchscreens, the RK817 codec and the speaker amplifiers, the battery.
   Wi-Fi and Panfrost are modules, loaded after the menu is up. No fbcon, no VTs, no boot logo.
4. busybox init runs `/etc/init.d/rcS`: mount `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, `/tmp`, the data partition; start
   `bananad`; set the menu's clocks. Wi-Fi, the clock and the rest go to the background.
5. init starts `banana-ui`. It opens the panels and plays the boot animation from its first frame while another
   thread reads the library and builds the menu; when both are done it dissolves into the menu (four steps of an
   ordered dither in the animation's own pixel size). `splash = off` in settings.conf goes straight to the menu.

What is worth measuring on the device: U-Boot to kernel, kernel to init (the MMC probe and `rootwait`), and init
to the menu's first frame. The kernel's `initcall_debug` and banana-ui's log (it logs the library scan's time)
give the last two.

## The menu: banana-ui

ROCKNIXDS Pixel is drawn by an engine that knows nothing about EmulationStation (`ui/rnds`, imported unchanged
from ROCKNIXDS by `tools/import-rnds.sh`): a *Source* gives it systems, games and status, a *Backend* draws its
textures, and it rasterizes everything else itself (CSS-like boxes, Pixelify Sans text, fitted pictures). In
ROCKNIXDS, ES is the Source and its GL renderer the Backend. In Banana:

- **Source** (`src/library.cpp`): the systems in `/etc/banana/systems.conf` (or the copy in `/data/banana/`),
  their icons and colours from the theme's `systems.cfg`, the games found in each system's folder, names and art
  from an EmulationStation `gamelist.xml` when one is there (a card scraped under ROCKNIX keeps its art) or from
  `media/box|cart|label/<rom name>.png`, and Banana's own play counts, play time and favourites.
- **Backend** (`src/soft.cpp`): software, on the CPU. Each screen's draw calls are recorded and compared with the
  last frame's; a screen whose list didn't change keeps its pixels (most animations move one screen). A screen
  that changed is drawn from black, mostly with copies: each texture's rows are stored as runs of transparent,
  opaque and blended pixels, so opaque runs are `memcpy`, transparent runs are skipped and only edges are
  blended. In the benchmark (`bench` in a headless script) an idle frame costs well under a millisecond on a PC.
- **Display** (`src/kms.cpp`): KMS dumb buffers, two per panel, page flips on vblank. The screens are composed in
  cached memory and only changed rows are copied into the (uncached) scanout buffer.
- **Main loop** (`src/main.cpp`): `poll()` on the buttons, the touchscreen, the DRM device (flip events), the
  picture worker and signals, with a timeout from the engine's next animation step or the next minute (the
  clock). Nothing runs while nothing changes.

**Settings** (`src/settings.cpp`, Start): drawn with the engine's own box styles and Pixelify Sans through the
same Backend. Each change is written at once to the file that owns it: `banana/settings.conf` (the menu; a theme
change rebuilds the engine in the other palette), `banana/bananad.conf` (then SIGHUP to bananad), 
`banana/superdrastic.conf` (read by run-drastic), DraStic's `drastic.cfg`, and the backlights.

**Low battery**: at 20% (the LED turns red), 10% and 5% (it blinks) on the battery, a notice in the bubble style
over the bottom of the top panel for 8 s, the status bar's battery three times its size; any button hides it.
Each step shows once until the charger has been on, and a step passed during a game shows when the menu is back.
banana-ui reads the battery with the clock (once a minute), after a game and after a wake; bananad does the
shutting down. The notice is drawn by the backend at the end of the top screen's draw list, so it shows over the
settings too and costs nothing while it doesn't change.

Starting a game: banana-ui writes the game's pid to `/run/banana/game.pid`, closes the display, the input
devices and the sound device, sets the system's clock profile, and runs its `run` command. When the game exits it
takes the panels back, records the play, and shows the game's library again.

## Sleep: bananad

`bananad` reads every input device next to the menu and the games (evdev allows several readers; it grabs
nothing). Closing the lid (the hall sensor, `SW_LID`), a short press of power, or 10 idle minutes in the menu put
the handheld to sleep:

1. The game's process group gets `SIGSTOP` (ROCKNIX found DraStic's dynarec must not run on while the clocks drop).
2. `/etc/banana/sleep.d/*` run with `pre` (Wi-Fi down and its driver unloaded: the RTL8821CS doesn't survive a
   suspend otherwise; nothing at all when Wi-Fi is off).
3. `sync()`: this kernel has `SUSPEND_SKIP_SYNC`, so the flush is bananad's (with saves written within 2 s anyway,
   `vm.dirty_expire`).
4. The RTC alarm for the battery check (`sleep_check_hours`, 4), devices set to resume in parallel
   (`/sys/power/pm_async`, `fast_resume`; ROCKNIX's kernel patch turns it off by default), `deep` in
   `/sys/power/mem_sleep`, and `mem` to `/sys/power/state`: TF-A powers the SoC down, DRAM self-refreshes.

The device tree makes the lid (on opening only) and the RK817 PMIC (the power key, the RTC alarm) wakeup sources.
When `/sys/power/state` returns:

- **The battery check's alarm** (the RTC clears `wakealarm` when it fires): at `sleep_poweroff_percent` (5%) or
  under, the game gets `SIGCONT` and then `SIGTERM` to write its saves, and the handheld shuts down; otherwise
  straight back to sleep, nothing else run.
- **Anything with the lid still shut** (the power button pressed in a bag): straight back to sleep.
- **The lid opened, or the power button with the lid open**: the game gets `SIGCONT` and banana-ui `SIGUSR1` (a
  redraw: the kernel's DRM resume has already put our buffers back on the panels, so no modeset), all within a
  fraction of a millisecond of the kernel returning; then the `post` hooks (Wi-Fi back) in the background, the LEDs,
  the headphone route; the press that woke it is ignored.

If a suspend fails, bananad goes on more carefully by itself: devices one at a time, then `s2idle`; if even that
fails with the lid shut, both backlights go off until it opens. With lid sleep switched off, closing the lid only
turns the backlights off. Every sleep is a line in `banana/logs/sleep.log` (time to suspend, time asleep, why it
woke, how long the game and the menu took to come back); with `sleep_debug = yes` the kernel's per-device times go
to `banana/logs/sleep-devices.log`, slowest first.

What a wake costs is then the kernel's device resume: on the RG DS mostly the two panels' power-on sequences
(ROCKNIX's 20 + 10 + 50 ms, the init commands and 120 ms after sleep-out, one panel after the other) and the SD
card; on the RG DS Plus the panels take about a fifth of that. `system/bananad/tests/sleep-test.sh` runs all of the
above against a made-up `/sys` in its own namespaces (a FIFO for `/sys/power/state`, real input events for the lid).

Hold power 2 s to shut down; volume keys change the mixer, F + volume the backlights; a battery at 3% and
discharging shuts down cleanly. Settings: `/etc/banana/bananad.conf`, overridden by `/data/banana/bananad.conf`
(the settings screen writes it and sends SIGHUP).

## The rest of the hardware

**Panels.** Each panel's timing is text in the device tree (the generic DSI driver's `panel_description`). The RG
DS's carries ROCKNIXDS's measured retune (`board/rgds/dts-patches`): front porches 233 and 21 instead of 260 and 10,
60.0013 Hz from the real 42133334 Hz clock instead of 60.10 Hz. `banana-panel-tune` runs once per card after the
first boot: it reads each VOP's real pixel clock (`dclk_vop0/1` in debugfs' clk_summary), looks for the smallest
front porch change within 0.002 Hz of 60 that keeps every number's digit count, and rewrites the boot DTB in place
when that gains at least 0.005 Hz. The RG DS is left as it is; the RG DS Plus goes from 60.17 Hz to 59.999 Hz
(with the clock it asks for, 62.77 MHz; the real one decides). Its report: `banana/panel-tune.txt`.

**LEDs.** `green:power`, `red:status` and `amber:charging` (pwm-leds). bananad sets them only when the battery's
state changes, which the kernel announces as power_supply uevents (a netlink socket; there is no udev): the amber
LED follows the charger's own LED trigger (`<battery>-charging`), the critical blink is the kernel's timer trigger.

**Sound.** No sound server: ALSA's default device is written by bananad to `/run/banana/asound.conf`. RG DS: the
rk817 (card 0) with its `Playback Mux` on HP. RG DS Plus: playback on the aw88166 card, or on the rk817 while its
`Headphones Jack` switch is on; capture always from the rk817 (the microphone). Volume keys: `PCM` on the aw88166,
`Master` on the rk817. A program opened before a change keeps its device until it opens it again.

## Hardware support

`buildroot/board/rgds` is ROCKNIX's RK3566 support at a pinned commit (`ROCKNIX`), copied by
`tools/sync-rocknix-hw.sh`: its kernel patches in its own order, the RG DS and RG DS Plus device trees, its kernel
config (Banana's changes are in `linux-banana.fragment`), the generic DSI panel and joypad drivers (built in via
`external.mk`), the input-polldev patch the joypad driver needs, its U-Boot patches, and the RK3568 BL31 it boots
with. A newer ROCKNIX is one command and a diff.
